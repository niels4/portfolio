    <p class="description_text">
      I am a software engineer with experience building data intensive dashboards that simplify comprehension by using
      graphics and animations that can be understood at a glance.
    </p>
    <p class="description_text">
      I collaborate with designers and product owners to quickly prototype and demo new features. I have extensive
      real-world experience taking ideas from prototype to production. Once deployed, I set up integration tests and
      real-time health monitoring to ensure the feature operates correctly at all times.
    </p>
    <p class="description_text">
      To scale up the UI team, I evaluate candidates, make hiring decisions, and set up onboarding processes to ensure
      new team members are productive and ready to contribute from day one. I am always available to assist fellow
      engineers who need direction or help working through a problem.

    <li>First UI engineer hired by the founders, later became tech lead for the UI and public API.</li>
    <li>
      Collaborated with special effects artist <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mn8studio.com/">Jake Sargeant</a>
      (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2681088/">Tron Legacy, Oblivion</a>)
      to design, build, and launch the ProtectWise user interface demonstrated in the video above.
    </li>
    <li>
      Pushed the limits of browser technology at the time to deliver a dynamic and responsive user interface typically
      only seen in desktop applications.
    </li>
    <li>
      Made use of scaled vector graphics (SVG) for visualizations, web workers for perfoming cpu heavy tasks off of the
      main UI thread, and websockets for bidirectional realtime communication between the UI and API.
    </li>
    <li>
      Built a custom websocket API that would subscribe to kafka data streams to aggregate, format, and deliver live
      streaming data to meet the unique data requirements needed to drive the UI.
    </li>
    <li>
      Helped grow the company by interviewing and making the final call in the hiring process for new engineers on
      the UI and API teams.
    </li>
    <li>
      Built health check systems to immediately send an alert to pager duty whenever the API was having troubles
      performing its required tasks.
    </li>
    <li>
      Helped prototype experimental 3D immersive interfaces using the Oculus/Meta Quest and the Microsoft HoloLens.

  <h3 class="portfolio_sub_header">2. Websocket Text Relay</h3>

  <img class="wtr_screenshot" src="images/wtr-screenshot.png" alt="Websocket Text Relay screenshot">

  <p class="description_text">
    I built this tool because I needed a way to develop complex SVG visualizations and the existing
    feedback loop delay between making code changes and seeing them show up in the browser was taking too long. Even a 5
    second delay to build the app and refresh the page is disruptive when I need to make several changes per second in
    order to fine tune things like colors, size, spacing, etc. For years this project existed as a quickly hacked
    together
    vim plugin that was only set up to work on my machine.
  </p>

  <p class="description_text">
    I wanted to create a portfolio project that demonstrated how I was able to build the ProtectWise UI, so I turned
    this side project into a tool that any web developer can understand, install, and use in their own text editor.

    I first converted the app to use the language server protocol (LSP) to be able to communicate with any LSP
    compatible text editor.

    Using the tool itself, I created a status UI (pictured above) that allows users to view the current status of the
    running servers and connected front end clients.

    Finally, I published the language server along with the text editor plugins and a few examples of how to use them on
    github.
